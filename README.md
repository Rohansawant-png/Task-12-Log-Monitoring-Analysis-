## 🧠 Project Overview
Logs are one of the most important components of cybersecurity monitoring and incident response.  
In this task, system logs were analyzed to identify suspicious activities such as failed login attempts, anomalies, and potential security incidents.

This task helps in understanding how organizations detect attacks using log data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand different types of system logs  
- Analyze authentication logs  
- Identify failed login attempts  
- Detect anomalies and suspicious behavior  
- Learn the basics of SIEM systems
